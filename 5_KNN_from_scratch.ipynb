    "Using the KNN algorithm from scikit-learn is quite simple. When you use it, you don't even need to know how KNN works and classifies the data points. The goal should be to really understand what you are doing. This is the only way to make sure you understand when something doesn't go the way you expect or want it to. Many people remember things best when they implement them themselves. So, let's build our own K-Nearest-Neighbors classifier!\n",

    "**The purpose of this notebook is to help you remember the steps necessary to classify samples with KNN.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if your code works, you can use the Iris dataset as a data example.\n",
    "Let's make a plan and break this big task into smaller steps!\n",

    "1. What information and data does the algorithm need to train and predict the classes of new instances?\n",
    "This will be the input for our function! \n",
    "\n",
    "2. calculate the distance between the test point and each existing data point in the training data.\n",
    "3. determine the nearest k neighbors.\n",
    "4. make predictions based on these neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already implemented a function to calculate the distance between points, which will now come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to get started, is to ignore the syntax and just write in simple text what you want your program to do aka **write pseudo-code**. You can then start to build out some of the structure. What variables are you going to need? What kinds of logic? \n",
    "Knowing where you’re going can help you make fewer mistakes as you’re trying to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for large data sets, the algorithm can take very long to classify because it has to calculate the distance between the test point and every other point in the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if your pseudo-code contains all necessary steps afterwards, when scrolling down to \"KNN algorithm from scratch\" where you find an example of a knn pseudo-code."

Here's a link to the scikit-learn scaling package: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html . You have to be a little circumspect about employing any technique where the answers change with scaling."
